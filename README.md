### Introduction

Welcome to my CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app, a fully functional web application built using Python Flask as the backend and React as the frontend.

Contacts are linked by ID, and users can modify fields such as name, email, and notes.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` folder.
2. Run `python main.py` to start the Flask server.
3. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` folder.
4. Run `vite` to start the React development server.
