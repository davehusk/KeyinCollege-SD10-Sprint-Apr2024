# Dave Husk
# Sprint for April 2024
# Keyin College - SD10

___
For the Sprint I ran out of time trying to figure out why 
I was getting so many errors and couldn't run it on my 
machine. When I found the problem, it was because of the 
commands used in terminal to install it. In 2024 React changed
the way you start it up, according to sources online. 

I really dislike the way React has to install itself locally, 
there are too many areas for a problem to arise. I love Python
so I wanted to use it as the backend.

I am late for handing this in, and I don't have a Figma
design for this either as I had to start over from scratch 
Tuesday after my meeting with Keyin's upper management, Steve

I requested the meeting, I prepared for over a week and I was
so excited to show. When the meeting started and he was asking
me questions as if he had no idea who I was, I asked about
the extra I've been doing, but he had no idea where I was even
living (Burin Peninsula). At the end of the call I pretty
much had a mental breakdown, from 'officials' that supposedly
have the power to help people, but no drive or willpower to 
even give me a moment. The meeting I had with him was an 
utter dissappointment, so I decided to make a quick CRUD app
so I can make notes or save a contact in json, with plans to 
make it an assistant with AI

## CRUD App


There are two folders, 'backend' and 'frontend'. 

### backend                         python main.py

  - The backend uses Flask which is a 
    Python application, to handle the JSON-Server side. 

  - open terminal in the backend folder and run
      ```
      python main.py
      ```
A development server will run on your local pc to serve the
database and json work on port 5000


## frontend               python manage.py runserver 5000

The frontend uses React and JavaScript with Vite, less
time waiting on compiling, more time for coding.
